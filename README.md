# Dynamic Components & SVG.

> This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

The main idea about this project is to understand that we can use SVG files like web components.

So, we can extend the characteristics for our SVG images and reuse them on another projects.

## Development server

> Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
